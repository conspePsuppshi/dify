## What is Reshade and How Does It Work?
 
Reshade is a free and open-source software that works with any DirectX or OpenGL game. It injects a layer of code into the game's rendering process and modifies the output image according to your settings.
 
Reshade does not modify the game files or interfere with the game's performance. It only affects how the game looks on your screen. You can toggle it on and off with a hotkey, and adjust the settings in real-time using a user-friendly interface.
 
Reshade has a large community of users and developers who create and share presets for various games. A preset is a file that contains a set of effects and parameters that define a specific look for the game. You can download presets from websites like [reshade.me](https://reshade.me/presets) or [sfx.thelazy.net](https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/game/1/), or make your own using the built-in editor.
